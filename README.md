# Studio-2-Management-System

As part of my Upper 6th A-Level Coursework (2015-2016) for Software Systems Development, I was asked to create a management system and database for a gym.

This is a C# Windows Console Application which incorporates a SQL database. If a valid staff username and password are entered, the user will be taken to the main menu. From here there are several sub-menus. 

Users can add/edit/delete members, bookings, memberships, staff members and classes to/from the system. The details will be adjusted accordingly in the database and updated for future use. 

Reports can also be generated within the system for maintaining classes/class sizes and generating member cards.
